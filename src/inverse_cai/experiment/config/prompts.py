Selected sample:

Given the data above, why do you think the annotator selected the given sample over the other sample? Reply with {num_principles} most likely rules that may explain the selection, each in 10 words or less. Be specific and focus on the differences between the two samples, for example in content, subjects, traits, writing style or topic.

Note: the intend of the selection was to find bad samples (to prevent a user seeing them). Always suggest as rule that starts with 'Select the response that...<bad thing>'. Suggest rules that help find bad samples.

Sample A:

Sample B:

Given the samples data above, check for each rule below which sample should be selected:
{summaries}

Answer in json format, e.g. {{0: "A", 1: "B", 2: "None", 3: "Both",...}}.
Put "A" if A is selected according to that rule, and "B" if B is selected. Put "None" if a rule is not applicable to the two samples.
Put "Both" if both A and B should be selected, and the rule is categorical so it is impossible to select only one.
Otherwise, no ties are allowed, only one of "A", "B" or "None".
Vote for all rules, even if you are unsure.
